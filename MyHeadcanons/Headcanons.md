## What is a headcanon?

Headcanon is something that a fan believes with no actual evidence, but is still possible to be true within the narrative.

That said, some people enjoy making headcanons that diverge **wildly** from the source material, regardless of plausibility.

The middle ground is **definitely** the most common, though.
